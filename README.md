### üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Configuration

To begin the server installation, ensure that **Python 3.12** is installed on your system. You will also need the source code, which can be cloned using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidsantana06/sweet-server
```

Once you have the files, create a `.env` file based on the template provided in `.env.example`. In this file, specify the following fields:

- `SECRET_KEY` - Server secret key, which should be long and contain multiple characters;
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` - A list of addresses (or domains) allowed to make requests to the server, separated by space.

Next, install the application dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, start the server with:

```bash
flask --app app run
```

This process can be performed within a virtual environment.

#### üóÉÔ∏è Essential Data Creation

The essential data can be found in `storage\setup.json`. This file contains the following keys:

- `"category_names"` - A list containing the names of recipe categories;
- `"payment_method_names"` - A list containing the names of accepted payment methods;
- `"default_collaborator_data"` - An object with the default collaborator data, without remuneration.

The keys have their default values and can be customized as needed, as long as the format is respected.

### ‚öñÔ∏è License
